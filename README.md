# PRFF codes in python
This repository contains the codes of Pseudo Random Fourier Features for Approximating RBF kernels. The potential of this method is demonstrated in the classification and regression tasks.

For details of this method, please refer to: [Data Dependent Kernel Approximation using Pseudo Random Fourier Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09783)


File to run:

MainFile_OptPRFF_RFF_Nyst_ORF.py

- this file includes RFF, PRFF (proposed), ORF, and Nystrom method

- for the Psudeo random fourier features, please have a look at:prff_bharath.py and prff.py(variant)


For the ORF, you need to install the 'revrand' library
